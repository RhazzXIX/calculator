TOP Foundation Project 5

Live: https://rhazzxix.github.io/calculator/

This project will present all of the knowledge I've learned from the 
Odin Project fundamentals. HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamental knowledge
will be used.

Reflection:
There will be times that multiple function (esp eventListeners) will do
the same thing. It will be much better to create a single function and 
call it rather than typing, copy/pasting the code again.
